# Social Mapper
A Social Media Enumeration &amp; Correlation Tool

Coming August 9th 2018

## Usecases (Why you want to run this)
Social Mapper can be used to correlate a paired list of names and images across social media sites, searching for targets and matching them with facial recognition. It then generates reports listing targets with their enumerated profiles

It's primarily aimed at Penetration Testers and Red Teamers, who will use it to expand their target lists and find their social media profiles. From here what you do is only limited by your imagination, but here are a few ideas:

*(Note: Social Mapper does not perform these attacks, it gathers you the data you need to perform them on a mass scale.)*

* Create fake social media profiles to 'friend' the targets and send them links or malware. Recent statistics show social media users are more than twice as likely to click on links and open documents compared to those delivered via email. 
* Trick users into disclosing their emails and phone numbers with vouchers and offers to make the pivot into phishing, vishing or smishing.
* Create custom phishing campaigns for each social media site, knowing that the target has an account. Make these more realistic by including their profile picture in the email. Capture the passwords for password reuse. 
* View target photos looking for employee access card badges and familiarise yourself with building interiors
